This was a Business Data group project. We analyzed trends and forecasted book checkout time series by
 genre and medium using ARIMA or SARMAX models. Additionally,
 we studied the life cycles of some NYT best-selling books by
 examining correlations among coefficients in non-linear diffusion
 models like the Bass Model, Generalized Bass Model, and Guseo
Guidolin Model.
